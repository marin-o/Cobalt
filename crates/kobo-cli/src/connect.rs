//! Finding a device on the network, and installing onto it over Wi-Fi.
//!
//! A Kobo is an awkward thing to reach. It powers Wi-Fi down when it sleeps,
//! it takes a new address from DHCP every time it comes back, and it never
//! says any of that out loud, the symptom is always the same connection
//! timeout. Most of the time lost to this project has been lost to guessing
//! which of those is happening.
//!
//! So the two commands built on this module are deliberately unglamorous.
//! `kobo devices` sweeps the local network and names what it finds, which
//! answers "what is its address now". [`OFFLINE_HELP`] is printed by every
//! command that fails to reach a device, which answers "why can I not reach
//! it". Neither needs an argument, because someone who knew the argument would
//! not be reading either message.

The device did not answer. In order of how often each one is the cause:

  1. The reader is asleep, so its Wi-Fi is off. Press the power button, wait
     for the home screen, and try again. Nothing on a Kobo keeps Wi-Fi up
     through sleep by default.
  2. Wi-Fi is off while awake. On the reader: the top bar, then the Wi-Fi
     icon, then join the network. Toggling airplane mode on and back off
     reconnects it faster than anything else when it is being stubborn.
  3. Its address changed. A Kobo takes a new one from DHCP on every
     reconnection, so the address that worked yesterday is often somebody
     else's today. Run 'kobo devices' to find it.
  4. SSH is not running on it. Cobalt does not install an SSH server, but the
     firmware ships one, switched off. Connect the reader by USB and run
     'kobo setup': it enables that server, installs Cobalt, and ejects. The
     server starts at the next restart, so restart the reader afterwards.

Once it answers, 'kobo session --device <ip> --wifi-always-on on' stops the
reader powering the radio down while you work, and 'kobo session --device <ip>
--keep-awake on' stops it suspending. Both are reversible and both clear on a
reboot.";

///
/// A certificate for Paperterm has to name an address the reader can reach,
/// and "your-computer" is what the pairing screen used to say when nobody had
/// passed --host: an instruction to go and find something the companion
