//! Asking before running on hardware nobody has measured.
//!
//! Cobalt used to refuse any reader outside its table outright, and the refusal
//! reached a log file nobody had a reason to look in. From the owner's chair a
//! menu entry simply did nothing, which is the worst of both: no session, and
//! no way to find out why.
//!
//! It now runs, and asks first. The question is deliberately narrow. It states
//! what has not been tested about this exact device, says what could go wrong
//! in terms of what the owner would see, and offers to go back. Nothing here
//! claims the session is safe, because that is the one thing nobody has the
//! evidence to say.
//!
//! # Why acceptance is recorded and refusal is not
//!
//! An owner who accepts has decided something about their hardware that will
//! not change until the hardware or the firmware does, so asking again every
//! launch would be nagging. An owner who declines has decided nothing except
//! "not now", and the honest response to that is to ask again next time rather
//! than to remember a no and act on it forever.
