//! The single verified entry point for changing the display.
//!
//! Nothing else in this project may submit a hardware update. Opening a
//! [`DisplaySession`] proves, at runtime, that:
//!
//! 1. the probed hardware geometry matches the profile exactly,
//! 2. the device code, serial model prefix, and kernel release match the
//!    profile exactly,
//! 3. the profile's owner-attended evidence is complete, and
//! 4. the caller supplied the exact owner-attended unlock phrase.
//!
//! [`DisplaySession::open_including_untested`] relaxes the third of those, and
//! the firmware version alongside it, for a reader whose owner has been told
//! what is unproven about their hardware and has agreed to it. It relaxes
//! nothing in the first two: geometry, touch and model identity stay exactly as
//! strict, because those are the checks that catch a profile describing a
//! different device rather than an untested one.
//!
//! The module is compiled only with the non-default `device-write` feature, so
//! a default build contains no callable display-write code at all.
